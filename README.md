# Estimation-Theory
Code for working on Estimation Theory based problems from Dr. Todd Humphreys' ASE381K course at UT Austin.

Questions are provided for each problem set and then the associated code is included in MATLAB or (rarely) Python.

All code is my own with questions or data provided by Dr. Todd Humphreys.

## Problem Set Descriptions ##
PS4 : non-linear estimators

PS5 : Kalman filters

PS6 : Square Root Information Filters and Smoothing
