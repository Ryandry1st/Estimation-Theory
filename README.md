# Estimation-Theory
Code for working on Estimation Theory based problems from Dr. Todd Humphreys' ASE381K course at UT Austin.

Questions are provided for each problem set and then the associated code is included in MATLAB or (rarely) Python.

Some boilerplate code is provided by Dr. Todd Humphreys, as well as most data included.

## Problem Set Descriptions ##
PS4 : non-linear estimators

PS5 : Kalman filters

PS6 : Square Root Information Filters and Smoothing

PS7 : Iterated Extended Kalman Filter

PS8: Multimodal, Particle Filters
